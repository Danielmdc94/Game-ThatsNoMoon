# Game-ThatsNoMoon
<p>This game is the first project I've ever done in unity as well as my first coding experience. I wanted to make a game from scratch so all assets are made by me with Blender.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>&emsp;WASD to move</p>
<p>&emsp;SPACE to shoot</p>

<p>Avoid the Tie-Fighters, Laser Towers and obstacles while flying down the Death Star trenches</p>
<p>Get the Rebel symbol pick-up to gain a shield that blocks lasers for a short duration</p>
<p>Destroying Tie-Fighters and Laser Towers will give you points</p>
